          1-way flow had allowed blockchain based protocols to take advantage of
          users’ willingness to embrace well-marketed and optically
          well-intentioned efforts by pre-positioning in substandard quality
          VCCs. Pools with a wide range of acceptable VCC specifications, are
          subject to Gresham’s law (low quality assets driving out high quality
          assets), by warping price signals for exactly the projects that should
          not be scaled

          Thea will initially present high-quality carbon credits with N-GEO
          equivalent specification or better, to engender trust and position in
          the market segment where maximum impact is expected as well as
          anticipate the standards according to which ESG focused corporates
          will commence activity.  NBT characteristics will be anchored to
