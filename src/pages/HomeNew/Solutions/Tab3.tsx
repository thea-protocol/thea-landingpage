          Away from some blockchain based solutions, users do not have
          visibility on timing of the retirement action associated with their
          offsetting decision. The optionality associated with this timing
          mismatch and lack of transparency is either exploited by the platform
          or left unmonetized.

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <div>
          Users retire VCCs on Carbon Offset Events Â® and have the opportunity
          to commit to buy NBTs at a lower price or sell NBTs at a higher price
          than the one prevailing today; rendering cash spending into a return
          generating action with positive environmental impact.
